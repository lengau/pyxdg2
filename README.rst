PyXDG2
======

This is a reimplementation of freedesktop.org's PyXDG_ in modern Python.
It depends only on features in the Python 3.8+ standard library.

Note: This is *not* a drop-in replacement for PyXDG. The ``xdg`` submodule may eventually do so, but that that is currently unimplemented.

This does not depend on PyXDG, but instead implements tho standards as defined in the freedesktop.org specs.
